## Description

This workshop will give participants an overview of the basics of R and RStudio. R is a simple programming environment that enables the effective handling of data, while providing excellent graphical support. RStudio is a tool that provides a user-friendly environment for working with R.

These materials are intended to provide a quick overview of the R programming language.

## Learning Objectives

* **R syntax:** Understanding the different 'parts of speech' in R; introducing variables and functions, demonstrating how functions work, and modifying arguments for specific use cases.
* **Data structures in R:** Getting a handle on the classes of data structures and the types of data used by R.
* **Data inspection and wrangling:** Reading in data from files. Using indices and various functions to subset, merge, and create datasets.
* **Exporting data:** Generating new data tables for use outside of the R environment.

## Installations

Download the most recent versions of R and RStudio:

 - [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) 
 - [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
