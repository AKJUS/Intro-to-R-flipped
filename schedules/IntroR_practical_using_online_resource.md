## Learning Objectives

1. **R syntax**: Understand the different 'parts of speech'.
2. **Data types structures in R**: Describe the various data types and data structures.
3. **Data inspection and wrangling**: Demonstrate the utilization of functions and indices to inspect and subset data from various data structures

## Installations

Download the most recent versions of R and RStudio:

 - [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
