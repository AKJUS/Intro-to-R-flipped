## Learning Objectives

* Determine whether the same values are present in two vectors
* Identify whether the same values are in the same order in two vectors

## Logical operators for identifying matching elements 

Oftentimes, we encounter different analysis tools that require multiple input datasets. It is not uncommon for these inputs to need to have the same row names, column names, or unique identifiers in the same order to perform the analysis. Therefore, knowing how to reorder datasets and determine whether the data matches is an important skill.

In our use case, we will be working with genomic data. We have gene expression data generated by RNA-seq, which we had downloaded previously; in addition, we have a metadata file corresponding to the RNA-seq samples. The metadata contains information about the samples present in the gene expression file, such as which sample group each sample belongs to and any batch or experimental variables present in the data. 

Let's read in our gene expression data (RPKM matrix) that we downloaded previously:

```r
rpkm_data <- read.csv("data/counts.rpkm.csv")
```

>**NOTE:** If the data file name ends with `txt` instead of `csv`, you can read in the data using the code: `rpkm_data <- read.csv("data/counts.rpkm.txt")`. 

Take a look at the first few lines of the data matrix to see what's in there.

```r
head(rpkm_data)
```

It looks as if the sample names (header) in our data matrix are similar to the row names of our metadata file, but it's hard to tell since they are not in the same order. We can do a quick check of the number of columns in the count data and the rows in the metadata and at least see if the numbers match up. 

```r
ncol(rpkm_data)
nrow(metadata)
```

What we want to know is, **do we have data for every sample that we have metadata?** 

## The `%in%` operator
 
Although lacking in [documentation](http://dr-k-lo.blogspot.com/2013/11/) this operator is well-used and convenient once you get the hang of it. The operator is used with the following syntax: 

```r
vector1_of_values %in% vector2_of_values
```

It will take a vector as input to the left and will **evaluate each element to see if there is a match in the vector that follows on the right of the operator.** *The two vectors do not have to be the same size.* This operation will return a vector of the same length as vector1 containing logical values to indicate whether or not there was a match. Take a look at the example below:

```r
A <- c(1,3,5,7,9,11)   # odd numbers
B <- c(2,4,6,8,10,12)  # even numbers

# test to see if each of the elements of A is in B	
A %in% B
```

```r
## [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
```

Since vector A contains only odd numbers and vector B contains only even numbers, there is no overlap and so the vector returned contains a `FALSE` for each element. Let's change a couple of numbers inside vector B to match vector A:


```r
A <- c(1,3,5,7,9,11)   # odd numbers
B <- c(2,4,6,8,1,5)  # add some odd numbers in 
```

```r
# test to see if each of the elements of A is in B
A %in% B
```

```r
## [1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE
```

The logical vector returned denotes which elements in `A` are also in `B` and which are not.  

We saw previously that we could use the output from a logical expression to subset data by returning only the values corresponding to `TRUE`. Therefore, we can use the output logical vector to subset our data, and return only those elements in `A`, which are also in `B` by returning only the TRUE values:

![matching1](../img/in-operator1.png)

```r
intersection <- A %in% B
intersection
```

![matching2](../img/in-operator2.png)

```r
A[intersection]
```

![matching3](../img/in-operator3.png)

In these previous examples, the vectors were small and so it's easy to count by eye; but when we work with large datasets this is not practical. A quick way to assess whether or not we had any matches would be to use the `any` function to see if **any of the values contained in vector A are also in vector B**:

```r
any(A %in% B)
```

The `all` function is also useful. Given a logical vector, it will tell you whether all values returned are `TRUE`. If there is at least one `FALSE` value, the `all` function will return a `FALSE` and you know that all of A are not contained in B.

```r
all(A %in% B)
```
***
[**Exercise 1**](../results/answer_keys/07_matching_answer_key.md#exercise-1-solution)

1. Using the `A` and `B` vectors created above, evaluate each element in `B` to see if there is a match in `A`

2. Subset the `B` vector to only return those values that are also in `A`.

***
Suppose we had **two vectors that had the same values but just not in the same order**. We could also use `all` to test for that. Rather than using the `%in%` operator we would use `==` and compare each element to the same position in the other vector. Unlike the `%in%` operator, **for this to work you must have two vectors that are of equal length**.

```r
A <- c(10,20,30,40,50)
B <- c(50,40,30,20,10)  # same numbers but backwards 

# test to see if each element of A is in B
A %in% B

# test to see if each element of A is in the same position in B
A == B

# use all() to check if they are a perfect match
all(A == B)

```

Let's try this on our data and see whether we have metadata information for all samples in our expression data. We'll start by creating two vectors; one with the `rownames` of the metadata and `colnames` of the RPKM data. These are base functions in R which allow you to extract the row and column names as a vector:

```r
x <- rownames(metadata)
y <- colnames(rpkm_data)
```

Now check to see that all of `x` are in `y`:

```r
all(x %in% y)
```

*Note that we can use nested functions in place of `x` and `y`:*

```r
all(rownames(metadata) %in% colnames(rpkm_data))
```

We know that all samples are present, but are they in the same order:

```r
all(rownames(metadata) == colnames(rpkm_data))
```

**Looks like all of the samples are there, but will need to be reordered. To reorder our genomic samples, we will learn different ways to reorder data in our next lesson. But before that, let's work on exercise 2 to consolidate concepts from this lesson.**

***
[**Exercise 2**](../results/answer_keys/07_matching_answer_key.md#exercise-2-solution)

We have a list of 6 marker genes that we are very interested in. Our goal is to extract count data for these genes using the `%in%` operator from the `rpkm_data` data frame, instead scrolling through `rpkm_data` and finding them.

First, let's create a vector called `important_genes` with the Ensembl IDs of the 6 genes we are interested in:

```r
important_genes <- c("ENSMUSG00000083700", "ENSMUSG00000080990", "ENSMUSG00000065619", "ENSMUSG00000047945", "ENSMUSG00000081010", "ENSMUSG00000030970")
```

1. Use the `%in%` operator to determine if all of these genes are in the row names of the `rpkm_data` data frame.	
	
2. Extract the rows from `rpkm_data` that correspond to these 6 genes using `[]` and the `%in%` operator. Double check the row names to ensure that you are extracting the correct rows.

3. **Bonus question:** Extract the rows from `rpkm_data` that correspond to these 6 genes using `[]`, but without using the `%in%` operator.
